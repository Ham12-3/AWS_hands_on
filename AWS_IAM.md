# In this section, I created and IAM user using the following steps,

first of all, I went to the IAM section in my root account, then I searched for IAM in my AWS services section, then I checked that IAM is a global service as no region was specified
, afterwards I clicked on User, then create user:
![aws-1](https://github.com/Ham12-3/AWS_hands_on/assets/93613316/649d851e-74f6-4bb0-8fcf-3752b0497be2)

Then I created a custom password for myself, then I unclicked the changing of password because it is a demo, but if I want it done real life, I will have to check the changing of password for security purposes.
Then afterwards, I created next and then I created a group called admin and gave it AdministratorAccess so that I can attach the user (abdulhamid to the group)
![aws-2](https://github.com/Ham12-3/AWS_hands_on/assets/93613316/e68db637-5d7a-41f7-af87-64230fb7f617)


Then after that, I added tags to the AWS user(department, engineering)
![aws-3](https://github.com/Ham12-3/AWS_hands_on/assets/93613316/9c797251-2702-4bdf-b11e-891d900739ab)
Then after the user has been created successfully, I then returned to the users list to show the list of users
![aws-4](https://github.com/Ham12-3/AWS_hands_on/assets/93613316/2249f4ed-272f-4c13-baae-40ec13b8017c)
